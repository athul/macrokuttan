# MacroKuttan

MacroKuttan is a Macropad with Raspberry Pi Pico and [KMK Firmware](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware). It's a budget macropad made shy of **$13 ≈ ₹1000**.
It's a handwired keyboard with a 3D printed case. Me and a group of friends did this together to try out the "Mechanical" switches.
