# MacroKuttan

MacroKuttan is a Macropad with Raspberry Pi Pico and [KMK Firmware](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware). It's a budget macropad made shy of **$13 ≈ ₹1000**.
It's a handwired keyboard with a 3D printed case. Me and a group of friends did this together to try out the "Mechanical" switches.

## Items List

|       Item        | Price | Number of Items |
| :---------------: | :---: | :-------------: |
| Raspberry Pi Pico | ₹349  |        1        |
|     Switches      |  ₹18  |        9        |
| Case(3D Printed)  | ₹200  |        1        |
|  Diodes(1N4148)   |  ₹2   |        9        |

Total = ₹740 + Delivery Charges for Case and Switches(₹100 per person).

I had some old keycaps lying around which I salvaged from an old keyboard with too scratchy mx-blacks. Using that added a vintage flair to the macropad.

> The Keycaps weren't added since it was out of stock. Will update the table when in stock(probably ₹200/- for 10)

## Things I've tried

- First time soldering
- Using a Microcontroller for the First time
- Played with a Rotary Encoder with KMK
- Added a LED with a breathing animation. This gives an undeglow effect
